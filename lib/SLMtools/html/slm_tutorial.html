  </style></head><body><div class="content"><h1></h1><!--introduction--><p>The following script is a tutorial on the methodology of what I call "Shape Prescriptive Modeling". Its a tool for modeling a function of a single variable</p><pre>  y = f(x) + error</pre><p>The actual model will be in the form of a least squares spline. Shape prescriptive modeling is really a way of thinking about a model - it has a lot of very Bayesian underpinnings. I'll get to that in a bit. First, lets talk about modeling, who builds models, and why we choose a specific model form.</p><p>Why do we, as scientists and engineers, fit a curve to data? There are really two basic reasons why, if we ignore the common "My boss told me to do this." The first such reason is for purely predictive value. We may wish to reduce some set of data to a simply accessible functional relationship for future use. The process of modeling may allow us to smooth the data, producing a smooth curve where only distinct data points fell before. As well, this smooth curve is now a platform for interpolation. Note that if we have smoothed the data, removing unwanted noise that was present in the data, then the interpolant is more an approximant. I.e., one will not interpolate the data, but a smoother form of it.</p><p>The second common goal of curve fitting is often to predict/estimate some parameter of the relationship, such as a minimum or maximum value where the curve approaches an asymptote, or perhaps a maximum slope or a rate parameter.</p><p>If we are to fit a model to data, what kind of models do we use, and how does the model class reflect our goals in the modeling process? To answer this question, I'll first look at the common modeling tools we might see. First and most primeval is polyfit. Polyfit allows us to fit a polynomial model to our data. Such a model tells us little about our process beyond perhaps a simple slope. These models are really of value only for very simple relationships, where we are willing to invest little in the modeling process. Many of the individuals who use polynomial modeling tools do so for the wrong reasons. They use higher order polynomial fits to get a better approximation to their data, not realizing the problems inherent with those higher order polynomials.</p><p>At the other end of the spectrum, one sees individuals using nonlinear regression to fit a large variety of curves to data. Exponential terms, gaussian-like modes, sigmoid shapes, as well as many more. Did these model forms result from valid mechanistic arguments? I.e., has the analyst developed a real model of the process under study, where all that is left is to estimate the parameters of that model from data?</p><p>Sometimes it is so, but far more often the analyst individual knows something about the basic underlying process, and the model chosen has the correct basic functional shape. I'll argue that truly valid mechanistic models are nearly as rare as hen's teeth.</p><p>There is a subtle variation on the mechanistic model. I call it the metaphoric or metaphorical model. Here we use a mathematical model of one process that we do understand, used as a model for a process that we do not really understand. My favorite examples of such metaphorical models are cubic splines, where a mathematical model of a thin flexible beam is used to predict many other processes. A second good example is the use of epidemiological models as used to predict sales of some product. There are many other examples of course.</p><p>An advantage of a metaphorical model is it may help us to understand/ predict/even extrapolate future behavior based on our knowledge of the metaphor. Many of the nonlinear regression models that we see built in Matlab are of the shape variety. I.e., we see a bell shaped curve, so we fit a gaussian to it. We see a function with a lower and upper constant asymptote, and we fit some variety of logistic function, or an erf variant to it. If the fit is inadequate for our purposes, we try another functional form. I'll argue that this group of individuals is often using nonlinear regression for the wrong reason. They simply want some curve that behaves the way they know it should. Examples of this might be a photographic film modelor, who knows the film darkens as more photons land upon it, or a biologist, who knows that the count of bacteria in a petri dish will grow with time. (All of these examples have limits, but a good scientist/engineer will know those limits.)</p><p>The fact is, we often understand something about a process we are trying to model. What we may not have is the ability to build that knowledge and understanding into our model. Even if we know the underlying functional relationship is monotone increasing/decreasing, how do we estimate a model that has that behavior built into it? This is where shape prescriptive modeling shines. It is really a very Bayesian concept. It is the process of quantifying our basic knowledge of a process in mathematical terms, and then estimating a predictive model of the process that has that knowledge built into it. Our knowledge becomes a prescription for the final shape of the process. Sometimes we know much about a process, in which case we have a detailed prescription. Other times we have a very sketchy prescription.</p><p>The slm tools in this toolkit are designed to help the user to embed their knowledge into a model using a langauage of shape. One builds a prescription for the desired shape, then combines it with their data to build a model. These steps can be done distinctly, where an explicit prescription is created, then applied with a modeling engine to data, or the prescription can be built in a fluid manner using a gui. Here a point and click interface can provide the information necessary.</p><p>Some final notes before we begin actual experimentation: This toolkit assumes possession of the optimization toolbox.</p><p>Also, all examples will use the commandline engine for modeling, instead of the gui interface. One good reason is that at the time of writing this tutorial, I had not finished writing the gui. A better reason is that anything that can be done via the gui is also possible to do using the computational engine, and cell mode favors this approach.</p><p>Finally, ...</p><!--/introduction--><h2>Contents</h2><div><ul><li><a href="#1">Some data</a></li><li><a href="#2">Polyfit?</a></li><li><a href="#7">Less data, more noise, with polyfit</a></li><li><a href="#9">A piecewise linear SLM fit</a></li><li><a href="#11">Shape prescriptions</a></li><li><a href="#13">Use of slmset</a></li><li><a href="#14">Evaluating a model</a></li><li><a href="#18">Plotting a model using plotslm</a></li><li><a href="#19">slmengine can plot too</a></li><li><a href="#20">Computations on a spline model, min max, integral, etc.</a></li><li><a href="#28">Curvature constraints</a></li><li><a href="#29">Monotonicity constraints</a></li><li><a href="#30">Both curvature and monotonicity constraints</a></li><li><a href="#31">Minimum slope or maximum slope constraints</a></li><li><a href="#35">Extrapolation in the fit, non-uniform knot spacings</a></li><li><a href="#36">Piecewise constant models</a></li><li><a href="#38">Fixed specific values</a></li><li><a href="#39">Flawed information, "Garbage in, garbage out"</a></li><li><a href="#54">Too many knots?</a></li><li><a href="#58">Use in practice</a></li><li><a href="#64">Returning a set of points, evaluated through the fitted curve.</a></li><li><a href="#65">Combining various constraints to produce a better model</a></li><li><a href="#69">Extrapolation of a spline model</a></li><li><a href="#75">You can get information about the fit itself</a></li><li><a href="#77">Knot placement optimization</a></li></ul></div><h2>Some data<a name="1"></a></h2><p>Lets start out by creating some data.

It works on a property/value pair interface. There are a wide variety of properties that one can set, enough to satisfy almost any type of information a user can bring to a modeling problem. Here are the options one can set:</p><pre class="codeinput">help <span class="string">slmset</span>
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">  slmset: defines the shape prescription for a model
  usage 1: prescription=slmset(prop1,val1,pro2,val2,...)
  usage 2: prescription=slmset(prescription,prop1,val1,pro2,val2,...)
 
   A set of property/value pairs are parsed into a structure
   to use as the prescription for slmengine and slmfit.
  
  arguments:
   prop, val - property/value pairs (see below for the complete list)
           There is no limit on the upper number of property/value
           pairs allowed.
           Property names may be shortened, as long as they are
           unambiguous. Case is ignored.
 
   prescription - shape prescription structure, defining that
           which the user is willing to say about the model.
           The fields of the prescription structure reflect
           the defaults, plus any modifications specified.
           This structure will control the behaviours built
           a curve fit by slmengine or the defaults for slmfit.
 
 
  Property/value pairs:
 
  Properties are character strings, chosen to be mnemonic of their
  purpose. Any property name may be shortened, as long as the
  shortened string is unambiguous. Thus since no other property
  starts with the letter k, any of these alternatives are acceptable
  shortenings for the 'knots' property:  'knot', 'kno', 'kn' or 'k'.
  In the event that a given property is assigned more than once in the
  list of property/value pairs, only the last value in the list is
  assigned.
 
  Property names &amp; admissable values:
 
  'C2     - Most users want their cubic spline curves to be as
          smooth and differentiable as possible. For a cubic
          spline, this is called a twice continuously differentiable
          function, here simply 'C2'. Of course, if your spline is not
          cubic, this specification is blithely ignored.
 
          = 'on' --&gt; Causes the result to be twice differentiable
            across the knots.
 
          = 'off' --&gt; Allows a cubic spline to be only C1. The second
            derivative of the spline MAY have discontinuities across
            each knot of the spline.
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  'on'
 
          Comment: I would rarely recommend changing this option
          from the default.
 
  'concavedown' - controls curvature of the function
          = 'off'  --&gt; No part of the spline is constrained to be a
            concave down function (i.e., a negative second derivative.)
          = 'on' --&gt; f''(x) &gt;= 0 over the entire domain of the spline.
          = vector of length 2 denoting the start and end points of a
            region of the spline over which the second derivative is
            negative.
          = array of size nx2, each row of which denotes the start and
            end points of a region of the spline over which the second
            derivative is negative.
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  'off'
 
          Comment: curvature properties do not apply to piecewise
          constant functions.
 
          Comment: This constraint is equivalent to a monotone
          decreasing slope over the specified region.
 
  'concaveup' - controls curvature of the function
          = 'off'  --&gt; No part of the spline is constrained to be a
            concave up function (i.e., a positive second derivative.)
          = 'on' --&gt; f''(x) &gt;= 0 over the entire domain of the spline.
          = vector of length 2 denoting the start and end points of a
            region of the spline over which the second derivative is
            positive.
          = array of size nx2, each row of which denotes the start and
            end points of a region of the spline over which the second
            derivative is positive.
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  'off'
 
          Comment: curvature properties do not apply to piecewise
          constant functions.
 
          Comment: This constraint is equivalent to a monotone
          increasing slope over the specified region.
 
  'constantregion' - defines a region over which the curve is forced
          be constant, although the exact level is not defined.
          = [] --&gt; No region of the spline is forced to be a constant
            function.
          = vector of length 2 denoting the start and end points of a

          DEFAULT VALUE:  []
 
          Comments: A segment which is forced to be constant over
          only part of a knot interval must necessarily be constant
          over that entire interval, since the curve is composed of
          a single polynomial segment in a knot interval.
 
  'decreasing' - controls monotonicity of the function
          = 'off'  --&gt; No part of the spline is constrained to be a
            decreasing function.
          = 'on' --&gt; the function will be decreasing over its entire domain.

          = array of size nx2 --&gt; each row of which denotes the start
            and end points of a region of the curve over which it is
            monotone decreasing.
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  'off'
 
          Comments: in actuality this property should be named
          'non-increasing', since a constant function is admissible.
          In addition, it is a sufficient constraint for monotonicity.
          It is not a necessary constraint. There may exist another
          spline which has a slightly lower sum of squares and is also
          monotone.
 
  'degree' - controls the degree of the piecewise Hermite function
          = 'constant' --&gt; Use a piecewise constant "Hermite" 
          = 'linear' --&gt; Use a piecewise linear Hermite 
          = 'cubic' --&gt; Use a piecewise cubic Hermite 
          
          As a concession to memory, valid synonyms for 'constant'
          'linear', and 'cubic' are respectively the integers 0, 1, &amp; 3
          
          DEFAULT: 'cubic'
 
          Comment: Some properties are inappropriate for all degrees
          of function. E.g., it would be silly to specify a specific
          value for the left hand end point slope of a piecewise
          constant function. All information supplied will be used
          to whatever extent possible.
 
          The "order" of a form, as used by the spline toolbox, will
          be one more than the degree. 'order' is also a valid property
          in these tools, but it results only in setting the degree
          field, where degree = order - 1.
 
  'endconditions' - controls the end conditions applied to the spline
          = 'natural' --&gt; The "natural" spline conditions will be applied.
            I.e., f''(x) = 0 at end end of the spline.
          = 'notaknot' --&gt; Not-a-knot end conditions applied.
          = 'periodic' --&gt; Periodic end conditions applied.
          = 'estimate' --&gt; end conditions are estimated from the data.
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  'estimate
 
          Comment: Except for periodicity, end conditions are not
          relevant to any degree model below cubic.
 
          Periodic end conditions mean that the function values are
          the same at each end of the curve for linear and cubic fits.
 
          For cubic fits, periodicity means that the function has
          also first and second derivative continuity across the
          wrapped boundary.
 
          For piecewise constant fits, end conditions do not apply,
          and are ignored.
 
  'envelope' - allows the user to solve for an envelope of the data
          = 'off' --&gt; the curve will be a simple least squares spline
          = 'supremum' --&gt; comute a model such that all residuals
            (yhat - y) are positive. In effect, the curve will be a
            "supremum" (least upper bound) function.
          = 'infimum' --&gt; comute a model such that all residuals
            (yhat - y) are negative. In effect, the curve will be a
            "infimum" (greatest lower bound) function.
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  'off'
 
          Comment: this option should be rarely used, but its a cute
          idea when it does come up.
 
  'errorbar' - defines a set of lower and upper bounds for the function
          value of the spline at each data point. If there are n data
          points, then if the corresponding value is:
  
          = [] --&gt; No errorbar constraints will be imposed
          = a scalar E --&gt; error bars will be set at [Y-E,Y+E]
          = a vector E --&gt; error bars will be set at [Y-E,Y+E]
          = an nx2 array --&gt; error bars will be set at [Y-E(:,1),Y+E(:,2)]
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  []
 
          Comment: It is possible that depending on the choice of
          knots, it will be impossible to satisfy some sets of
          error bars. It may be best to simply use every single data
          point as a knot. Of course, replicate data points with
          non-overlappng error bars will always cause a failure.
 
  'extrapolation' - tells SLMEVAL how to extrapolate the function outside
          the defined knot points of the spline. This parameter has
          NOTHING to do with how the curve will be fit, but only
          with how it will be evaluated after the fit is done.
 
          = 'error' --&gt; No extrapolation will be allowed. An error
             will be returned if the user tries to evaluate the
             spline at any location outside of the knots.
 
          = 'warning' --&gt; A warning message will be generated when
             extrapolation is attempted, but extrapolation will still
             done as a constant value outside of the end point knots.
 
          =  'constant' --&gt; Constant extrapolation will be performed,
             using the value of the spline at the associated end point
             knot. This is the default, to be consistent with the
             behavior of this tool in previous releases.
 
          =  'linear' --&gt; Linear extrapolation will be performed,
             using the slope of the spline at the associated end point
             knot.
 
          =  'cubic' --&gt; Cubic extrapolation will be performed,
             using the shape of the spline at the associated end point
             knot.
 
          = 'NaN' --&gt; NaNs will be inserted for any attempted extrapolation.
             although no error or warning message will be generated.
 
          DEFAULT value: 'constant'
 
  'increasing' - controls monotonicity of the function
          = 'off'  --&gt; No part of the spline is constrained to be an
            increasing function.
          = 'on' --&gt; the function will be increasing over its entire domain.
          = vector of length 2 --&gt; denotes the start and end points of a
            region of the curve over which it is monotone increasing.
          = array of size nx2 --&gt; each row of which denotes the start
            and end points of a region of the curve over which it is
            monotone increasing.
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  'off'
 
          Comments: in actuality this property should be named
          'non-decreasing', since a constant function is admissible.
          In addition, it is a sufficient constraint for monotonicity.
          It is not a necessary constraint. There may exist another
          spline which has a slightly lower sum of squares and is also
          monotone.
 
  'integral' - known aim value for the integral of the curve over
          its domain.
          
          DEFAULT VALUE:  []
 
  'interiorknots' - allows for free knot placement (of the interior knots)
          = 'fixed' 
            spaced knots. In this case, the first data point will
            be the first knot.
          = 'free' --&gt; uses fmincon to optimize the interior knot
            placement to minimize the overall rmse.
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  'fixed'
 
          Comment: The initial values for the knot placement are
          taken from the knots property.
 
          Comment: Since the free knot placement is done by an
          optimizer (fmincon), it is not allowed to both choose
          a set of free knots and set the rmse of the fit.
 
          Comment: The first and last knots are not adjusted by
          the optimization, so there must be at least 3 knots.
 
          Comment: Piecewise constant functions sometimes have
          difficulty with free knots.
 
  'jerk' - Controls the sign of the jerk function over the support
          of the spline, to be either 'positive' or 'negative' (or no
          constraint at all applied.) This a global sign
          constraint on the third derivative of the function.
 
          = 'positive' --&gt; causes the third derivative to be
            everywhere positive over the support of the function
 
          = 'negative' --&gt; causes the third derivative to be
            everywhere negative over the support of the function
 
          = '' --&gt; No constraint applied
  
          DEFAULT VALUE: ''
 
          Comment: This property can be used to constrain the
          curvature of the function to be increasing (or decreasing)
          over the support, in combination with the concaveup or
          concavedown properties as appropriate.
 
          Comment: The third derivative is sometimes known as the
          'jolt', but from my experience, 'jerk' seems to be the
          most common name. I will add that the third derivative
          quite difficult to estimate for a spline model, especially
          if the data is at all noisy.t
 
  'knots' - controls the number of knots used, or the number of
            equally spaced knots.
 
          = A scalar integer which denotes the number of equally
            spaced knots. In this case, the first and last data
            points will be the first and last knots.
 
          = A vector containing the list of knots themselves.
            The knots must be distinct and MUST wholly contain
            the data or an error will be generated. No replicate
            knots are allowed.
 
          = A negative value K (no larger in absolute value than
            the number of data points - 1) causes every K'th data
            point to be used as a knot.
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  6
 
  'leftmaxslope' - controls the maximum slope allowed at the left hand
            end of the curve.
          = [] --&gt; No explicit value provided for the maximum slope
            of the spline at its left hand end point.
          = A numeric scalar --&gt; the slope of the function will be
            constrained to not rise above this value at its left
            hand end point (i.e., the first knot.)
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  []
  
  'leftmaxvalue' - controls the maximum valued allowed at the left hand
            end of the curve.
          = [] --&gt; No explicit value provided for the maximum value
            of the spline at its left hand end point.
          = A numeric scalar --&gt; the function will be constrained
            to not rise above this value at its left hand end point
            (i.e., the first knot.)
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  []
 
  'leftminslope' - controls the minimum slope allowed at the left hand
            end of the curve.
          = [] --&gt; No explicit value provided for the minimum slope
            of the spline at its left hand end point.
          = A numeric scalar --&gt; the slope of the function will be
            constrained to not fall below this value at its left
            hand end point (i.e., the first knot.)
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  []
 
  'leftminvalue' - controls the minimum valued allowed at the left hand
            end of the curve.
          = [] --&gt; No explicit value provided for the minimum value
            of the spline at its left hand end point.
          = A numeric scalar --&gt; the function will be constrained
            to not fall below this value at its left hand end point
            (i.e., the first knot.)
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  []
 
  'leftslope' - controls the function slope at the left hand endpoint.
          = [] --&gt; No explicit value provided for the slope of the
            curve at its left hand end point.
          = A numeric scalar --&gt; the function will be assigned this
            slope at its left hand end point (i.e., the first knot.)
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  []
 
  'leftvalue' - controls the function value at its left hand endpoint.
          = [] --&gt; No explicit value provided for the value of the
            curve at its left hand end point.
          = A numeric scalar --&gt; the function will be assigned this
            value at its left hand end point (i.e., the first knot.)
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  []
 
  'linearregion' - defines a region over which the curve is forced
          be linear, although the exact level is not defined.
          = [] --&gt; No region of the spline is forced to be a linear
            function.
          = vector of length 2 denoting the start and end points of a
            region of the spline over which it is a linear function.
          = array of size nx2, each row of which denotes the start and
            end points of a region of the spline over which it is a
            linear function.
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  []
 
          Comment 1: A segment which is forced to be linear over
          only part of a knot interval must necessarily be constant
          over that entire interval, since the curve is composed of
          a single polynomial segment in a knot interval.
          Comment 2: A linear region may extend across knots, in
          which case the slope will take on the same value across
          knot boundaries.
          
  'maxslope' - controls the globally maximum slope of the function
          = [] --&gt; No explicit value provided for the globally maximum
            slope of the curve.
          = A numeric scalar --&gt; the globally maximum slope of the spline
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  []
 
          Comment: This is a sufficient constraint for the maximum
          slope of the spline. It is not a necessary constraint.
          There may exist another spline which has a slightly lower
          sum of squares and also has the same maximum slope.
 
  'maxvalue' - controls the globally maximum value of the curve
          = [] --&gt; No explicit value provided for the globally
            maximum value of the spline.
          = A numeric scalar --&gt; the function must lie no higher
            than this maximum value.
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  []
 
          Comment 1: This constraint is only a necessary constraint.
          It is not sufficient. In some circumstances the spline may
          pass slightly above this maximum value
          Comment 2: The location of the global minimizer is unspecified.
 
  'minslope' - controls the globally minimum slope of the function
          = [] --&gt; No explicit value provided for the globally minimum
            slope of the curve.
          = A numeric scalar --&gt; the globally minimum slope of the spline
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  []
 
          Comment: This is a sufficient constraint for the minimum
          slope of the spline. It is not a necessary constraint.
          There may exist another spline which has a slightly lower
          sum of squares and also has the same minimum slope.
 
  'minvalue' - controls the globally minimum value of the curve
          = [] --&gt; No explicit value provided for the globally
            minimum value of the spline.
          = A numeric scalar --&gt; the function will lie no lower
            than this minimum value.
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  []
 
          Comment 1: This constraint is only a necessary constraint.
          It is not sufficient. In some circumstances the spline may
          pass slightly below this minimum value
          Comment 2: The location of the global minimizer is unspecified.
 
  'negativeinflection' - controls the existence and placement of a
            inflection point of the final curve. The second derivative
            of the function will pass through zero at this point.
 
          = [] --&gt; no inflection point constraint employed
          = a numeric scalar --&gt; the function will have a point of
            inflection at the supplied x location
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  []
 
          Comment: NegativeInflection is really just a composite property
          of a curve. A negative inflection point at x == a is equivalent
          to a ConcaveUP function for x&lt;=a, and a ConcaveDown function
          for x&gt;=a. As such, NegativeInflection will override any other
          curvature properties one has previously set.
 
          Comment: Inflection points only apply to linear or cubic models
 
  'order' - An implicit synonym for 'degree', controls the degree of
          the piecewise Hermite function. Order MUST be an numeric
          integer, from the set [1, 2, 4].
 
          = 1 --&gt; Use a piecewise constant "Hermite" 
          = 2 --&gt; Use a piecewise linear Hermite 
          = 4 --&gt; Use a piecewise cubic Hermite 
          
          DEFAULT: 4
 
          Setting the order to some value has the effect of setting
          the degree of the Hermite spline fit to one less than the
          order.
 
          Comment: Some properties are inappropriate for all degrees
          of function. E.g., it would be silly to specify a specific
          value for the left hand end point slope of a piecewise
          constant function. All information supplied will be used
          to whatever extent possible.
 
  'plot' - controls whether a final plot is generated of the curve
          = 'off' --&gt; No plot
          = 'on' --&gt; plot the curve and data using slmplot 
          
          DEFAULT VALUE: 'off'
 
  'positiveinflection' - controls the existence and placement of a
            inflection point of the final curve. The second derivative
            of the function will pass through zero at this point.
 
          = [] --&gt; no inflection point constraint employed
          = a numeric scalar --&gt; the function will have a point of
            inflection at the supplied x location
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  []
 
          Comment: PositiveInflection is really just a composite property
          of a curve. An inflection point at x == a is equivalent to a
          ConcaveDown function for x&lt;=a, and a ConcaveUp function for
          x&gt;=a. As such, PositiveInflection will override any other
          curvature properties one has previously set.
 
          Comment: Inflection points only apply to linear or cubic models
 
  'predictions' - The number of points to evaluate the curve at. Assumed
          to be equally spaced. The supplied value must be a positive
          scalar, integer value, &gt;= 2, or empty. If empty, no predictions
          will be generated.
          
          DEFAULT VALUE: []
 
          Comment: plotslm generates 1001 points along the curve.
 
  'regularization' - 
          = [] --&gt; Uses the default regularization parameter of 0.0001.
 
          = A Non-negative scalar value --&gt; explicitly defines the weight
            given to smoothness of the resulting curve.
 
          = 'crossvalidation' --&gt; Use cross validation method to choose
            the regularization parameter.
 
          = A NEGATIVE scalar value --&gt; attempts to choose a
            regularization parameter which has as its rmse the absolute
            value of the supplied value.
 
          = 'smoothest' --&gt; Finds the smoothest curve that satisfies
            the supplied prescription. This is not really a least
            squares model, since the goal is purely to maximize the
            smoothness. This option would very often be used in
            conjunction with errorbars.
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  0.0001
 
          Comment: Smaller values will yield less smoothing, larger
          values more smoothing. In most cases this parameter should
          be left alone. It is used to prevent numerical singularities
          in the linear algebra, as well as help in the case of
          extrapolation and intrapolation. Smoothness of the resulting
          spline can be far better controlled by changing the number
          of knots and their placement. Specifically, the regularization
          parameter is a scale factor applied to the integral of the
          squared second derivative of the spline.
 
          Comment: It is possible that no value for the regularization
          parameter will yield the given rmse. In this case the sky will
          fall down.
 
          Comment: Since the cross validation option and matching a
          given rmse are both optimizations, it is not allowed to use
          these options together with the interiorknots estimation.
 
          Comment: Both the cross validation and rmse options can
          both be quite slow. Remember that they are optimizations.
 
  'result' - controls the output structure style
          = 'pp'  --&gt; Returns a pp struct, use ppval to evaluate

          = [] --&gt; No explicit value provided for the maximum slope
            of the spline at its right hand end point.

  'robust' - Controls the use of a simple robust solver, employing
            iteratively reweighted least squares.
          = 'off' --&gt; Simple ordinary least squares is employed
          = 'on' --&gt; Performs iteratively re-weighted least squares
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  'off'
 
          Comment: when weights are also supplied, iterative
          re-weighting is applied on top of those weights.
 
          Comment: Beware use of the robust fitting option combined
          with other options such as:
 
             free interior knots
             an rmse goal
             cross-validation as a choice of a regularization parameter
 
          In combination with the robust fitting option, any of those
          options may introduce instabilities in the result and will at
          best be slow.
 
  'scaling' - controls data scaling to avoid numerical problems
          = 'on' --&gt; data is shifted and scaled so as to minimize
            any numerical problems that may result in the solution.
          = 'off' --&gt; No scaling is done.
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  'on'
 
          Comments: There is no transformation that will positively
          eliminate all problems, but this transformation will
          somtimes make the solution a bit kess prone to problems.
          All scalings are undone in the final spline coefficients,
          so these parameters are completely transparent to the user.
          In most cases you would see no difference in the solution,
          with or without scaling.
 
          Any scaling is automatically applied to both the data as
          well as all provided prescription parameters.
 
          The actual shift and scale parameters applied will be reported
          as part of the stats.
 
  'segmentconstant' - Allows the user to specify the index of a constant
          segment or segments. This is for the rare case where the knots
          may be free, yet there is a known internal constant region, so
          perhaps one always needs the second polynomial segment to be
          exactly constant even though the knots vary in their placement.
 
          The index of the knot interval which is to be held fixed is
          supplied. More than one interval may be so held fixed. If there
          are N knots, then the supplied index must be an integer between 1
          and N-1.
 
          Comment: This property is meaningless for piecewise constant
          splines.
          
          Comment: Cubic splines with constant segments will still have
          the overall degree of continuity. This may result in strange
          looking curves if there are several segments held constant.
          
          DEFAULT Value:  []
 
  'segmentlinear' - Allows the user to specify the index of a linear
          segment or segments. This is for the rare case where the knots
          may be free, yet there is a known internal linear region.
 
          The index of the knot interval which is to be held fixed is
          supplied. More than one interval may be so held fixed. If there
          are N knots, then the supplied index must be an integer between 1
          and N-1.
 
          This property is meaningless for piecewise constant or linear
          splines.
 
          DEFAULT Value:  []
 
  'simplepeak' - controls the existence and placement of a single
            maximizer of the final curve
 
          = [] --&gt; no peak placement constraint employed
          = a numeric scalar --&gt; the function will attain its maximum
            at the supplied x location
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  []
 
          Comment: SimplePeak is really just a composite property of
          a curve. A peak at x == a is equivalent to a monotone increasing
          function for x&lt;=a, and a monotone decreasing function for
          x&gt;=a. As such, simplepeak will override any other monotonicity
          properties one has previously set.
 
  'simplevalley' - controls the existence and placement of a single
            minimizer of the final curve
 
          = [] --&gt; no valley placement constraint employed
          = a numeric scalar --&gt; the function will attain its minimum
            at the supplied x location
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  []
 
          Comment: SimpleValley is really just a composite property
          of a curve. A valley at x == a is equivalent to a monotone
          decreasing function for x&lt;=a, and a monotone increasing
          function for x&gt;=a. As such, simplevalley will override any
          other monotonicity properties one has previously set.
 
  'sumresiduals' - Allows the user to specify an explicit goal for the
          sum of the residuals. This is a property that virtually
          NOBODY should ever have a need for, since normally you get
          a zero sum implicitly, as a freebie. This is due to the
          presence of an effective constant term in the regression
          model. Under some circumstances however, that property is
          circumvented, for example by forcing the model to explicitly
          pass through a given point. Use of non-unit weights in the
          model could also cause a non-zero sum of residuals.
 
          In practice, any real scalar value for the sum of the
          residuals can be specified, but a value of 0 is the only
          value that makes any sense that I can see. Weights on the
          data points are disregarded when the residual sum is
          computed.
 
          The computation of residual here is defined as [yhat - y].
          
          DEFAULT VALUE: []
 
  'verbosity' - controls commandline feedback to the user
          = 0 --&gt; No response at the commandline
          = 1 --&gt; Basic fit statistics reported at the command line
          = 2 --&gt; Debug level output
          
          DEFAULT VALUE: 0
 
  'weights' - defines a weight vector 
          = [] --&gt; all data points are assigned equal (unit) weight.
          = vector of the same length as length(x), denotes relative
            weights for each data point. If supplied, the length of
            this vector of weights must be the same as the number of
            data points.
 
          DEFAULT VALUE:  []
 
  'xy'  - Forces the curve through an individual point or set of points
          = [] --&gt; no points are forced
          = a 1x2 vector --&gt; an x-y pair that the curve must pass
            through with no error.
          = an nx2 array --&gt; each row corresponds to a single point
            that the curve passes through.
          
          DEFAULT VALUE: []
 
          Comment 1: The curve will pass through the desired point
          to within computational error, IF it is possible to do so.
          Comment 2: Multiple points that are inconsistent with each
          other, or inconsistent with other parameters that are set
          will cause failure of the least squares.
 
  'xyp'  - Forces the curve to have a specified slope at an individual
          point or set of points
          = [] --&gt; no points have their slope enforced
          = a 1x2 vector --&gt; an x-yprime pair that the curve must
            satisfy through with no error.
          = an nx2 array --&gt; each row corresponds to an x-yprime
            pair that the curve must satisfy.

          within computational error, IF it is possible to do so.
          Comment 2: Multiple points that are inconsistent with each
          other, or inconsistent with other parameters that are set
          will cause failure of the least squares.
          Comment 3: Setting the slope at some point of a zero'th
          degree function will be ignored.
 
  'xypp' - Forces the curve to have a specified second derivative
          at an individual point or set of points
          = [] --&gt; no points have their 2nd derivative enforced
          = a 1x2 vector --&gt; an x-y'' pair that the curve must
            satisfy through with no error.
          = an nx2 array --&gt; each row corresponds to an x-y''
            pair that the curve must satisfy.
          
          DEFAULT VALUE: []
 
          Comment: The curve will satisfy the desired 2nd derivative
          to within computational error, IF it is possible to do so.
          Comment: Multiple points that are inconsistent with each
          other, or inconsistent with other parameters that are set
          will cause failure of the least squares.
          Comment: Setting the 2nd derivative at some point of a
          zero'th degree or linear function will be ignored.
          Comment: This property only applies to cubic models.
 
  'xyppp' - Forces the curve to have a specified third derivative
          at an individual point or set of points.
 
          Really, the only meaningful use of this property that I
          see under normal circumstances is to force a segment
          to be only quadratic, rather than cubic. Thus, by forcing
          the third derivative to zero at some point in the segment,
          since the third derivative of a cubic polynomial is a
          constant, will reduce the cubic to a quadratic.
 
          = [] --&gt; no points have their 3rd derivative enforced
          = a 1x2 vector --&gt; an x-y''' pair that the curve must
            satisfy through with no error.
          = an nx2 array --&gt; each row corresponds to an x-y'''
            pair that the curve must satisfy.
          
          DEFAULT VALUE: []
 
          Comment: Setting the 3rd derivative at some point of a
          zero'th degree or linear function will be ignored.

% to do this." The first such reason is for purely predictive value. We may
% wish to reduce some set of data to a simply accessible functional relationship
% for future use. The process of modeling may allow us to smooth the data,
% producing a smooth curve where only distinct data points fell before.
% As well, this smooth curve is now a platform for interpolation. Note that
% if we have smoothed the data, removing unwanted noise that was present
% in the data, then the interpolant is more an approximant. I.e., one
% will not interpolate the data, but a smoother form of it.
% 
% The second common goal of curve fitting is often to predict/estimate some
% parameter of the relationship, such as a minimum or maximum value where
% the curve approaches an asymptote, or perhaps a maximum slope or a rate
% parameter. 
%
% If we are to fit a model to data, what kind of models do we use, and
% how does the model class reflect our goals in the modeling process?
% To answer this question, I'll first look at the common modeling tools
% we might see. First and most primeval is polyfit. Polyfit allows us to
% fit a polynomial model to our data. Such a model tells us little about
% our process beyond perhaps a simple slope. These models are really of
% value only for very simple relationships, where we are willing to
% invest little in the modeling process. Many of the individuals who
% use polynomial modeling tools do so for the wrong reasons. They use
% higher order polynomial fits to get a better approximation to their
% data, not realizing the problems inherent with those higher order
% polynomials.
% 
% At the other end of the spectrum, one sees individuals using nonlinear
% regression to fit a large variety of curves to data. Exponential terms,
% gaussian-like modes, sigmoid shapes, as well as many more. Did these
% model forms result from valid mechanistic arguments? I.e., has the
% analyst developed a real model of the process under study, where all
% that is left is to estimate the parameters of that model from data?
% 
% Sometimes it is so, but far more often the analyst individual knows
% something about the basic underlying process, and the model chosen
% has the correct basic functional shape. I'll argue that truly valid
% mechanistic models are nearly as rare as hen's teeth. 
% 
% There is a subtle variation on the mechanistic model. I call it the
% metaphoric or metaphorical model. Here we use a mathematical model
% of one process that we do understand, used as a model for a process
% that we do not really understand. My favorite examples of such
% metaphorical models are cubic splines, where a mathematical model
% of a thin flexible beam is used to predict many other processes. A
% second good example is the use of epidemiological models as used to
% predict sales of some product. There are many other examples of course.
% 
% An advantage of a metaphorical model is it may help us to understand/
% predict/even extrapolate future behavior based on our knowledge of the
% metaphor. Many of the nonlinear regression models that we see built in
% Matlab are of the shape variety. I.e., we see a bell shaped curve, so
% we fit a gaussian to it. We see a function with a lower and upper
% constant asymptote, and we fit some variety of logistic function, or
% an erf variant to it. If the fit is inadequate for our purposes, we
% try another functional form. I'll argue that this group of individuals
% is often using nonlinear regression for the wrong reason. They simply
% want some curve that behaves the way they know it should. Examples of
% this might be a photographic film modelor, who knows the film darkens
% as more photons land upon it, or a biologist, who knows that the count
% of bacteria in a petri dish will grow with time. (All of these examples
% have limits, but a good scientist/engineer will know those limits.)
% 
% The fact is, we often understand something about a process we are trying
% to model. What we may not have is the ability to build that knowledge and
% understanding into our model. Even if we know the underlying functional
% relationship is monotone increasing/decreasing, how do we estimate a
% model that has that behavior built into it? This is where shape
% prescriptive modeling shines. It is really a very Bayesian concept.
% It is the process of quantifying our basic knowledge of a process in
% mathematical terms, and then estimating a predictive model of the
% process that has that knowledge built into it. Our knowledge becomes
% a prescription for the final shape of the process. Sometimes we know
% much about a process, in which case we have a detailed prescription.
% Other times we have a very sketchy prescription.
% 
% The slm tools in this toolkit are designed to help the user to embed
% their knowledge into a model using a langauage of shape. One builds
% a prescription for the desired shape, then combines it with their data
% to build a model. These steps can be done distinctly, where an explicit
% prescription is created, then applied with a modeling engine to data,
% or the prescription can be built in a fluid manner using a gui. Here
% a point and click interface can provide the information necessary.
% 
% Some final notes before we begin actual experimentation: This toolkit
% assumes possession of the optimization toolbox. 
% 
% Also, all examples will use the commandline engine for modeling,
% instead of the gui interface. One good reason is that at the time
% of writing this tutorial, I had not finished writing the gui. A
% better reason is that anything that can be done via the gui is
% also possible to do using the computational engine, and cell mode
% favors this approach.
% 
% Finally, ...

%% Some data
% Lets start out by creating some data. A simple functional form that
% we understand the shape of.
n = 100;
x1 = sort(rand(n,1));
y1 = exp(x1) + randn(n,1)/20;
plot(x1,y1,'ro')

%% Polyfit?
% First, lets build a simple model using polyfit.
P = polyfit(x1,y1,6);
xev = 0:.001:1;
yev = polyval(P,xev);

%%
% and plot the results on top of the data
plot(xev,yev,'g-',x1,y1,'ro')

%%
% Are you happy with the resulting curve? Perhaps. Much depends upon
% our goals in building a model for this process. How good of a fit
% do we really need, how much noise is there in the data? Does the
% model behave as we believe it should? Does this model have lack of
% fit? Actually, it looks pretty good to me, at least given the amount
% of noise in the data. But see what happens when I use a high order
% polynomial model.

%% 
% This one was just too much, with condition problems.
P = polyfit(x1,y1,15);
xev = 0:.001:1;
yev = polyval(P,xev);
%%
% and plot the results on top of the data
plot(xev,yev,'g-',x1,y1,'ro')

%% Less data, more noise, with polyfit
% Lets try again, only this time we'll use less data, with a much
% higher level of noise.
close
n = 30;
x2 = sort(rand(n,1));
y2 = exp(x2) + randn(n,1)/3;
plot(x2,y2,'ro')

P = polyfit(x2,y2,6);
xev = linspace(min(x2),max(x2),100);
yhat = polyval(P,xev);

hold on
plot(xev,yhat,'g-')
hold off
%%
% Its a clear example of overfitting this noisy data.

%% A piecewise linear SLM fit
% Now lets try using the slm tools. After all, its why we are
% working through this tutorial.
slm = slmengine(x2,y2,'degree',1,'plot','on')
%%
% note that the result from slmengine is a structure. It contains
% 7 fields, and has much the same information as the 'pp' form does.
%
% 'form' is (in this case) 'slm'. This means that the function
% this structure contains is a slm model. We could have had it
% return a pp form instead.
%
% 'degree' is the polynomial degree of the piecewise segments.
% 1 indicates a piecewise linear function, continuous across the
% breakpoints (or knots.) Note that the splines toolbox tends to
% use the term 'order', one more than the degree.
%
% 'knots' contains the set of knots or breakpoints. The default
% is to use 6 equally spaced knots, from min to max of the data.
%
% 'coef' is the set of coefficients of the spline model. I've used
% a Hermite form here. Its an easy one to understand, as well as
% to look at the coefficients and visualize the shape of the curve.
% The field coef contains the value of the function at the
% corresponding knot.
%
% 'prescription' is the default prescription. A bayesian might call
% it an uninformative prior. Its the list of all settings for every
% optional parameter one can set for a model. Since we specified
% nothing but the data in our call to slmengine, we get all defaults.
%
% Finally, there are fields for x and y. The model thus contains
% the data used to build it. This serves a documentation purpose
% but it also allows plotslm to work well later.


%% Shape prescriptions
% We can look at the parameters in slm.prescription, but now is as
% good a tiem as any to see what slmset does for us. Here are the
% default set of properties.
prescription = slmset

%%
% slmset is the tool that allows us to specify a variety of pieces
% of information to the engine.


%% Use of slmset
% Help slmset will list all the options. It works on a property/value
% pair interface. There are a wide variety of properties that one can set,
% enough to satisfy almost any type of information a user can bring to
% a modeling problem. Here are the options one can set:
help slmset

%% Evaluating a model
% One more thing before we return to fitting data. We can use the 
% models that we build in a predictive mode. 
slmeval(.5,slm)

%%
% slmeval can also differentiate the function (although piecewise
% constant models would have a zero derivative everywhere, with a
% singularity at every knot.) The third argument controls the order
% ofthe derivative to be generated.
slmeval(.5,slm,1)

%%
% and even compute an inverse at any point. 
slmeval(1.75,slm,-1)

%%
% We could plot the function as fit uing slmeval,
yhat = slmeval(xev,slm,0);
plot(x2,y2,'ro',xev,yhat,'b-')

%% Plotting a model using plotslm
% Or we could have plotted it using a nice utility that I've provided.
% Plotslm plots the curve, the data that it was built from, and the
% knots/breaks of the spline model. Plotslm also allows you to plot
% the residuals of the model to the data, or the derivatives of the
% curve. Finally, you can control many features of this plot using the
% plot menu.
plotslm(slm)

%% slmengine can plot too
% Or we could have just told our engine to plot after it finished
% estimating its curve fit. This time we will fit it as a cubic spline.
close all
slm = slmengine(x2,y2,'degree',3,'knots',4,'plot','on');

%% Computations on a spline model, min max, integral, etc.
% plotslm can plot the function derivatives or integral, and
% slmeval can evaluate the function, its derivatives or the inverse
% function at specific points. However, it is occasionally useful to be
% able to find the minimum (or maximum) value of a spline over some interval, or
% find the minimum or maximum value of the slope, or compute the integral of the
% curve between a pair of points.
%
% The slmpar function does these things, both for a slm form as well as a pp form.
x = -5:.1:5;
y = exp(-x.^2/2)/sqrt(2*pi) + randn(size(x))/100;
slm = slmengine(x,y,'plot','on','knots',15,'integral',1,'deg',3,'minval',0)
%%
% Of course, here the integral was forced to 1, so the integral should be correct.
res = slmpar(slm,'in')
%%
% The maximum value should occur very near zero.
[res,loc] = slmpar(slm,'maxfun')

% The next few examples show slmpar at work on a pp form, as created by spline:
x = linspace(-pi,pi);
y = sin(x);
pp = spline(x,y);
%%
% The overall integral should be zero, or as close as floating point
% computations can give us for the integral of a spline.
res = slmpar(pp,'integral')
%%
% The integral from 0 to pi should be 2.
res = slmpar(pp,'integral',[0,pi])
%%
% The maximum of a sine wave over its period is 1, and should occur at
% x = pi/2.
[res,loc] = slmpar(pp,'maxfun')
%%
% The minimum of a sine wave over [-1,1] should occur at the lower end point.
[res,loc] = slmpar(pp,'minfun',[-1,1])

%%
% A nice thing about plotslm is it overlays the knot positions
% on top of the curve. The knots are at the vertical green dotted
% lines.

%% Curvature constraints
% Having seen the fit above, one might wonder why one would use
% a shape prescriptive model at all. It appears to be little better
% than that 6'th order polynomial model we fit before using polyfit.

% We want to think in terms of fundamental shape primitives.

%% Extrapolation in the fit, non-uniform knot spacings

% to extrapolate a spline that was built over a smaller region.

%% Extrapolation of a spline model
% Normally, I try to push a user to NOT extrapolate a spline model.
% Cubic polynomial segments do squirrely things away from where they
% were used in a fit. So if you seriously tried to extrapolate a cubic
% spline, then don't be surprised to see it do silly things. For this
% reason the default for SLMEVAL is to only extrapolate as a constant
% function. Thus below the first knot or above the top knot, the spline
% prediction will take on the values of the function at the corresponding
% knot, but no more. Essentially only constant extrapolation is done.
%
% SLMSET does provide for other options in extrapolation, but only if you
% ask for it. The 'extrapolation' prescription may take on the values:
%
%  {'error', 'warning', 'constant', 'linear', 'cubic', 'NaN'}
%
% The default is 'constant'. For this case, constant extrapolation is
% done with with no warning generated for all points outside of the knots.
% The other options seem pretty stratight forward.
%
%  'error' generates an error if any point falls outside the knots.
%
%  'warning' generates a warning message, then does constant extrapolation.
%
%  'constant' does constant extrapolation. (The default)
%
%  'linear' does linear extrapolation.
%
%  'cubic' does cubic extrapolation.
%
%  'nan' inserts NaN values for all points outside the knots.

% below the first column isthe list of knots, while the second column the
% values of the sine function approximation at those knots.
[slm.knots,slm.coef]

% However, we can see the actual linear polynoial segments using slmpar.
% This option tells slmpar to create a cell array that lists the knot
% intervals over which each segment is defined, as well as the actual
% linear polynomial used over that interval, as a symbolic polynomial
% in the variable x.

% We can use slmpar to understand the pp form of a spline, and how the
% spline coefficients are stored. They are stored as the coefficients of a
% polynomial in standard matlab poly form, so highest order coefficient
% first. However, the pp form uses what I'll call a relative polynomial.
pp = slm2pp(slm)

%%
% We can list out the breaks (or knots if you choose) of the spline.
% between each pair of breaks, there is here a linear polynomial segment
% defined. However, the i'th such polynomial will be evaluated as if it
% lives in the interval [0,pp.breaks(i+1) - pp.breaks(i)]
pp.breaks
pp.coefs

%%
% So the first linear polynomial segment actually lives on the interval
[pp.breaks(1),pp.breaks(2)]

%%
% However, it is evaluated on the translated interval
[0,pp.breaks(2)-pp.breaks(1)]

%%
% This translation of the interval is not terribly important when one is
% working with linear spline segments, but when cubic (or even higher order)
% segments are employed, there may well be numerical issues if MATLAB is
% forced to take powers of very large numbers. Suppose for example, our
% spline was forced to be evaluated for numbers on the order of 1e10? Now
% forming the cube of such large numbers will cause massive loss of
% accuracy in the floating point numbers.

%%
% Similarly, we might create a cubic spline. Here I'll use only 4 knots,
% thus three cubic segments, but I'll generate data that lies in a
% different domain.
x = linspace(1e6,1e6 + 3,100);

% First, lets understand the Hermite form here. The first column below is
% the list of knots. The second column the function values at those knots,
% and the third column contains the first derivatives of the spline function
% at those knots. Personally, I've always had a preference for this form
% because one can easily visualize much about the shape of the cubic
% segments directly from those coefficients.
[slm.knots,slm.coef]

% Converting the spline to its pp form, we get:
pp = slm2pp(slm)

%%
% There are 4 breaks, so 3 segments. These coefficients presume the relative
% form for evaluation

% See however, what happens to the coefficients of the polynomials in the
% absolute form. Those coefficients are now a bit nasty for a cubic
% polynomial. If x is on the order of 1e6, I would expect to see a serious
% loss of accuracy.
cabs = slmpar(pp,'symabs')

% To compare the accuracy problems one would expect, what is the sin of
% a moderately large number?
sin(sym('1e6 + 0.5'))
sin(1e6 + 0.5)
slmeval(1e6 + 0.5,slm)

%%
% So the 4 knot spline fit itself was only accurate to about 3 significant
% digits. Lets now use polyval to evaluate those polynomials at that same
% effective location. The relative form returns a value that matches
% slmeval exactly, as well as being a viable value for the sine function.
% However, the absolute form just returns numerical junk.
